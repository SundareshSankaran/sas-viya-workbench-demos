# Linear Support Vector Classification (Linear SVC)
### (SAS Viya ML vs SciKit-Learn)Â¶
The use of RWD in clinical development can help to enhance the efficiency of clinical research and improve patient outcomes by informing better healthcare decisions. In this specific life sciences demo showcases Linear SVC classification in SAS Viya Workbench: scikit-learn, and using the SASViya.ML in Python.

### Demo Catalog
| Demo Name | Description | 
|-----------|-------------|
| parkinsonsSVC.ipynb | A synthetic dataset with approximately two million rows that focuses on Parkinson's Disease Classification. It contains various features related to patient health conditions and outcomes. The objective of this use case is to predict a patient's classification based on patient's clinical characteristics and other biomarkers. The target variable is a binary outcome variable. |
| covtypeSVC.ipynb| A synthetic dataset with approximately four hundred thousand rows |
