the data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters.\n","This model is commonly used for clustering or generating synthetic data.\n","\n","### How GMM Works:\n","\n","- GMM represents data as a mixture of multiple normal distributions (also known as Gaussian distributions).\n","- Each Gaussian is defined by a mean and variance, and is assigned a weight (the probability of belonging to that distribution).\n","- The model uses an iterative algorithm called Expectation-Maximization (EM) to estimate the parameters (mean, variance, and weight) for each Gaussian distribution.\n","- Once trained, we can use the model to generate new data points based on the learned distribution, or to cluster data by assigning probabilities of belonging to each
