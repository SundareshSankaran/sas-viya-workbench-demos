Each Gaussian is defined by a mean and variance, and is assigned a weight (the probability of belonging to that distribution).\n","- The model uses an iterative algorithm called Expectation-Maximization (EM) to estimate the parameters (mean, variance, and weight) for each Gaussian distribution.\n","- Once trained, we can use the model to generate new data points based on the
